## 👋 Who am I?
My name in **Konstantin** (or simply **Kostya**). Im **16 years old**. I am a **Python and C# developer** who like what he do Living in **Russia**, **Orechovo-Zuevo**.

I started learning programming languages in deep 2017. My first language was JavaScript.
At that moment, I wasn't interested in web development. I just learn it for myself.

In the past, in 2019 I hear about PHP Devel Studio that's allows you to write desktop application in PHP.
I was interested, because that's sounds good! It take 1 year and I have created terminal emulator, desktop shell and simple notepad (default for every coders 🙃).

After PHP, I learn C# and that's was my main programming language for next time (from 2020 to this moment).
I learn how to work woth **JSON**, **VK API**, **Windows API** and **more**. 
At the first time, I use C# only for desktop development. 
A-a-a-and, super interesting fact, I create my own programming language named **zScript**!
Source code of my language was looks like jungle.
After 2 months, I have terminated repository and end development of **zScript**.

At 2021 I was interested of learning another language. 
From 2021 to this time I have learned Python.
At now, I would like to learn C++ and Java. 
Java firstly, because its more similiar to C# (Microsoft Java, lol).
